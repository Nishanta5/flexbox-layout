                    "Phu is just arround that bend", our mountain guide shouts
                    out from 50 meters behind us, taking another swing from his
                    flask. we knowingly riase our eyebrows in sync and continue
                    tekking the sleep incline , not hopeful the guide's seventh
                    guess will be lucky. we're nine hours into day three of our
                    search for one of the most remote place in the world, a
                    village so isolated that the rest of Nepal wasn't aware of
                    its existence untill the seventies
